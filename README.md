Glitch is not persistent, and Zeit now does not have the tool-chain needed to install nodehun. So, I will need to manually run the following command after each pull request (it will require an updated fixture...):

```bash
node_modules/.bin/probot receive -e pull_request -p test/fixtures/pull_request.synchronize.json ./app.js
```

Things to do:
- change to submitting a review
- break suggestions into individual comments and tag line numbers

# Editor

## Setup

# Install dependencies
